# Treatment and HIV-1 set point viral load among men who have sex with men

This repository contains the code to reproduce the analysis of how increasing treatment prevalence impacts set point viral load (SPVL) evolution.     

This model is written in the R programming language.  It requires [EpiModel](http://www.epimodel.org), the epidemic modeling software, to be installed first, as well as [EvoNetHIV](https://github.com/EvoNetHIV).      

Within R:  
`install.packages("EpiModel")`     
`if(!require(devtools)) { install.packages("devtools") }`     
`library(devtools)`         
`devtools::install_github("EvoNetHIV/RoleSPVL")`
